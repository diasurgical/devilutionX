Locate SDL2 library

This module defines the following 'IMPORTED' targets:

::

  SDL2::Core
    The SDL2 library, if found.
    Libraries should link to SDL2::Core

  SDL2::Main
    The SDL2main library, if found.
    Applications should link to SDL2::Main instead of SDL2::Core



This module will set the following variables in your project:

::

  SDL2_LIBRARIES, the name of the library to link against
  SDL2_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find SDL.h
  SDL2_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL2
  SDL2MAIN_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL2main
  SDL2_VERSION_STRING, human-readable string containing the version of SDL2



This module responds to the following cache variables:

::

  SDL2_PATH
    Set a custom SDL2 Library path (default: empty)

  SDL2_NO_DEFAULT_PATH
    Disable search SDL2 Library in default path.
      If SDL2_PATH (default: ON)
      Else (default: OFF)

  SDL2_INCLUDE_DIR
    SDL2 headers path.

  SDL2_LIBRARY
    SDL2 Library (.dll, .so, .a, etc) path.

  SDL2MAIN_LIBRAY
    SDL2main Library (.a) path.

  SDL2_BUILDING_LIBRARY
    This flag is useful only when linking to SDL2_LIBRARIES insead of
    SDL2::Main. It is required only when building a library that links to
    SDL2_LIBRARIES, because only applications need main() (No need to also
    link to SDL2main).
    If this flag is defined, then no SDL2main will be added to SDL2_LIBRARIES
    and no SDL2::Main target will be created.


Don't forget to include SDLmain.h and SDLmain.m in your project for the
OS X framework based version. (Other versions link to -lSDL2main which
this module will try to find on your behalf.) Also for OS X, this
module will automatically add the -framework Cocoa on your behalf.


Additional Note: If you see an empty SDL2_LIBRARY in your project
configuration, it means CMake did not find your SDL2 library
(SDL2.dll, libsdl2.so, SDL2.framework, etc). Set SDL2_LIBRARY to point
to your SDL2 library, and  configure again. Similarly, if you see an
empty SDL2MAIN_LIBRARY, you should set this value as appropriate. These
values are used to generate the final SDL2_LIBRARIES variable and the
SDL2::Core and SDL2::Main targets, but when these values are unset,
SDL2_LIBRARIES, SDL2::Core and SDL2::Main does not get created.


$SDL2DIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
./configure --prefix=$SDL2DIR used in building SDL2.  l.e.galup 9-20-02



Created by Amine Ben Hassouna:
  Adapt FindSDL.cmake to SDL2 (FindSDL2.cmake).
  Add cache variables for more flexibility:
    SDL2_PATH, SDL2_NO_DEFAULT_PATH (for details, see doc above).
  Mark 'Threads' as a required dependency for non-OSX systems.
  Modernize the FindSDL2.cmake module by creating specific targets:
    SDL2::Core and SDL2::Main (for details, see doc above).


Original FindSDL.cmake module:
  Modified by Eric Wing.  Added code to assist with automated building
  by using environmental variables and providing a more
  controlled/consistent search behavior.  Added new modifications to
  recognize OS X frameworks and additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).
  Also corrected the header search path to follow "proper" SDL
  guidelines.  Added a search for SDLmain which is needed by some
  platforms.  Added a search for threads which is needed by some
  platforms.  Added needed compile switches for MinGW.

On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.
People will have to manually change the cache value of SDL2_LIBRARY to
override this selection or set the SDL2_PATH variable or the CMake
environment CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the search paths.

Note that the header path has changed from SDL/SDL.h to just SDL.h
This needed to change because "proper" SDL convention is #include
"SDL.h", not <SDL/SDL.h>.  This is done for portability reasons
because not all systems place things in SDL/ (see FreeBSD).
