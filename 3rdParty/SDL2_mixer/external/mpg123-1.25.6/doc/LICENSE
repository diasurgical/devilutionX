GNU says that the license terms go into a file called COPYING.
Go over to COPYING to read the license, then.

Or...

You stay a bit with me here and read some not really important text.
You could imagine that there was some important text here, though.
You could also imagine that you were not sitting
	in your office / living room / bathroom
		in front of one of these evil electronic brains
		(you didn't _print_ this file, did you?)
	but being at some happy place, far, far away.
You could also imagine being at some unhappy place.
If you indeed are at such an unhappy place, imagine you were sitting
	in your office / living room / bathroom
		in front of this shiny, though evil, electronic brain.
		Reading this pointless text.
			Wondering about what you could have achieved in the past moments
				if you wouldn't have continued reading this pointless text.
		Wondering if anything is worth being achieved at all.
	Or if it all is just...
pointless.
