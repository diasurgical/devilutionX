# What is DevilutionX

DevilutionX is a port of Diablo and Hellfire that strives to make it simple to run the game while providing engine improvements, bug fixes, and some optional quality of life features.

Check out the [manual](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki) for available features and how to take advantage of them.

For a full list of changes, see our [changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md).

# How to Install

Note: You'll need access to the data from the original game. If you don't have an original CD, you can [buy Diablo from GoG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/diablo) or Battle.net. Alternatively, you can use `spawn.mpq` from the [shareware](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionx-assets/releases/latest/download/spawn.mpq) [[2]](http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/demos/diablosw.exe) version, in place of `DIABDAT.MPQ`, to play the shareware portion of the game.

Download the latest [DevilutionX release](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/releases/latest) and extract the contents to a location of your choosing or [build from source](#building-from-source).

- Copy `DIABDAT.MPQ` from the CD or Diablo installation (or [extract it from the GoG installer](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki/Extracting-MPQs-from-the-GoG-installer)) to the DevilutionX folder.
- To run the Diablo: Hellfire expansion, you will also need to copy `hellfire.mpq`, `hfmonk.mpq`, `hfmusic.mpq`, and `hfvoice.mpq`.

For more detailed instructions: [Installation Instructions](./docs/installing.md).
