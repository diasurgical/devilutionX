"points|Shift + Left Mouse Button (on inventory): Move item to belt or equip/"
"unequip item|Shift + Left Mouse Button (on belt): Move item to inventory|||"
"$Movement:|Movement is controlled by the mouse.  The gauntlet on the screen "
"is your cursor.  Use this to indicate the destination of your character and "
"then left-click to move to that area. If you hold the mouse button down "
"while moving, the character will continue to move in that direction.||"
"$Selecting Items:|What you can interact with within the game is easily "
"identifiable. Move the cursor over any object or creature. If the object can "
"be picked up, attacked, activated or used in any way, it will be immediately "
"outlined. A description of the highlighted object appears in the text area "
"on the control panel.||Example: If you select a door and then left-click the "
"character will walk to the door and open it. If you left-click on a "
"highlighted weapon, the character will walk over to it and put it in his "
"inventory. If you left-click on a highlighted creature...||$Combat:|Combat "
"is initiated by left-clicking on a creature that has been highlighted. If "
"your character is equipped with a melee weapon (Sword, Mace, Ax, etc.) your "
"character will move to range and attack. If your character is equipped with "
"a bow, left-clicking will fire an arrow at the highlighted creature. Holding "
"down the shift key and then left-clicking allows the character to attack "
"without moving.||$Picking up Objects:|If you left-click on an item - such as "
"a weapon, shield, armor or book - your character will move to that item and "
"add it to his inventory automatically.||Useable items that are small in size "
"- such as a potion or scroll - are automatically placed in your 'belt', "
"located at the top of the Interface bar . When an item is placed in the "
"belt, a small number appears in that box. Items may be used by either right-"
"clicking on the item or pressing the corresponding number on the keyboard.||"
"If you do not have enough room in your inventory or belt for an item that "
"you try to pick up, it will fall from your grasp. Open your inventory screen "
"and try re-arranging or removing items to carry what you really want or "
"need.||$Inventory:|You can toggle the Inventory screen on and off by "
"clicking the INV> button on the control panel.  Items may be moved around in "
"your inventory by selecting them and then left-clicking to pick them up.  "
"When you pick up an item while in the inventory screen, your cursor changes "
"into the item. You can then place this item into empty spaces in your "
"inventory, swap them with other items in your inventory or equip them.||If "
"you have an item that you no longer wish to carry, simply grab the item from "
"your inventory and then left-click in the play area to drop it.||$Equipping "
"Items:|To equip an item, open the inventory screen and pick up the desired "
"item, either from play or from your inventory, placing it in the appropriate "
"box on the figure in the inventory screen. Weapons and shields go into the "
"large spaces to the  right or left of the figure. Two-handed weapons such as "
"bows and axes preclude the use of a shield and will take up both of these "
"large spaces.||Cloaks, robes, capes and all other armor must go in the "
"central torso slot of the figure. ||Helmets and caps go in the box over the "
"head of the character.||Rings go into the small boxes at the hands of the "
"figure.||Amulets go into the small box at the next to the neck of the "
"figure.||To change items that your character has equipped, pick up a new "
"item and place it on top of the item you wish to remove.  Your character "
"will automatically swap the items and the cursor will now change into the "
"item that was in that box.||$Usable Items:|Potions, elixirs and books are "
"classified as usable items.  These items can be used by right-clicking on "
"them in the inventory screen.  Books are too large to be placed in the belt, "
"but any potions or scrolls that are put there can also be used by pressing "
"the corresponding number on the keyboard.||$Gold:|You can select a specific "
"amount of gold to drop by right-clicking on a pile of gold in your "
"inventory. A dialog will appear that allows you to select a specific amount "
"of gold to take. When you have entered that number, your cursor will change "
"into that amount of gold.||$Item Information:|Many items in Diablo share "
"certain common attributes.  These are damage, durability, charges and "
"minimum requirements..||Damage: This is represented by a range that "
"indicates the minimum and maximum damage that item can inflict. A short "
"sword has a (2-6) after its name, meaning it inflicts a minimum of two "
"damage and a maximum of six when it hits. Damage can be modified by the "
"quality of the weapon, the character's strength and magical effects.||"
"Durability: This is the amount of damage that an item can take before it is "
"rendered useless. Durability is represented by a ratio of current durability "
"to maximum durability. A shield that has a durability of 15/20 would still "
"have 15 points of damage it could take from use before it was rendered "
"useless. Maximum durability can be affected by the quality of the item, "
"enchantments or repairs made upon the item. The minimum durability can be "
"raised by repairing an item.||Charges: Some items have charges associated "
"with them. Charges indicate how many times that item can be used to cast the "
"spell or affect indicated in its description.  Charges are represented by a "
"ratio of charges left to maximum charges. A staff that has charges listed as "
"2/5 could be used to cast 2 more spells before it was rendered powerless. It "
"could still be used to attack with as a physical weapon, however. Maximum "
"charges can be affected by the magic or recharges cast upon the item. "
"Minimum charges can be raised by recharging the item.||Minimum Requirements: "
"These are the minimum requirements that a character must meet to wield the "
"item. The more powerful an item is, the higher the minimum requirements will "
"be.  If a character does not meet these requirements, he will be unable to "
"equip the item and its name and information will be displayed in red.  The "
"item artwork will also have a red tint in the Inventory screen.||$Items "
"Classes:|There are three classes of items in Diablo - Mundane, Magic and "
"Unique:||Mundane items have no special attributes. Their information is "
"displayed in white text.||Magic Items are represented by blue names and text "
"descriptions. Use the Identify spell or speak to Cain in town to determine "
"their exact properties and attributes.||Unique items are represented by gold "
"names and text descriptions. Use the Identify spell or speak to Cain in town "
"to determine their exact properties and attributes.||$Skills & Spells:|You "
"can access your list of skills and spells by left-clicking on the SPELLS "
"button in the interface bar. This 'Spellbook' contains all of the skills and "
"spells that your character knows. Spells available through staffs are also "
"listed here. Left-clicking on the Icon of the spell you wish to ready will "
"place it in the 'select current spell' icon/area and set it as the current "
"readied spell. A readied spell may be cast by simply right-clicking in the "
"play area.||Left-clicking on the 'select current spell' button will also "
"open a 'Speedbook' menu that also allows you to ready a skill or spell for "
"use.  To use a readied skill or spell, simply right-click in the main play "
"area.|Shift + Left-clicking on the 'select current spell' button will clear "
"the readied spell||Skills are the innate abilities of your character. These "
"skills are different depending on what class you choose and require no mana "
"to use.||Warrior:|The Warrior has the skill of Repair Items. This allows him "
"to fix an item that has been worn by use or is damaged in combat. To "
"accomplish this, select the Repair Skill through the Spellbook or Speedbook "
"and right-click the mouse as if you were casting a spell. Your cursor will "
"change into a Hammer Icon that you will use to select the item to be "
"repaired.  Although Repairing an item in this way will decrease the maximum "
"durability of that item, it can be done without leaving the labyrinth.||The "
"Blacksmith can also repair items for a price. When the Blacksmith performs "
"this service, it does decrease the maximum durability of the item.||Rogue:|"
"The Rogue has the skill of Disarm Traps. This allows her to not only remove "
"traps, but also acts as a 'sixth sense' that warns her of where these "
"trapped items are located. To accomplish this, select the Disarm Trap skill "
"through the Spellbook or Speedbook and right-click the mouse as if you were "
"casting a spell.  Your cursor will change into a Targeting Cursor that you "
"will use to select the item to be disarmed.  The success of this attempt is "
"based on the level of the Rogue and the expertise of whomever set the trap.||"
"Sorcerer:|The Sorcerer has the skill of Recharge Staffs. This allows him to "
"focus his mana into an staff that has been drained of its magical energies.  "
"To accomplish this, select the Recharge Staffs skill through the Spellbook "
"or Speedbook and right-click the mouse as if you were casting a spell.  Your "
"cursor will change into a Staff Icon that you will use to select the item to "
"be recharged.  Although Recharging a staff in this way will decrease its "
"maximum charges, it can be done without leaving the labyrinth.||The Witch "
"can also recharge staffs for a price. When the Witch performs this service, "
"it does decrease the maximum charges of the item.||Spells are magical "
"effects that can be cast from a scroll, a staff or memorized from a book. "
"Spells may or may not require mana to use and are available to all classes.||"
"Spells cast from a scroll cost no mana to use, but are limited to only one "
"charge. Casting a spell from a scroll is accomplished by either right-"
"clicking on the scroll or, if it is located in our belt, pressing the "
"corresponding number on the keyboard. Scrolls can also be readied in the "
"Speedbook and are represented by a red icon/button in the 'select current "
"spell' area.||Spells cast from staffs cost no mana to use, but are limited "
"by the number of charges available. To cast spells from a staff, it must "
"first be equipped. The 'select current spell' icon/button will change to "
"indicate that the spell on the staff is currently ready to cast. Scrolls can "
"also be readied in the Spellbook or Speedbook and are represented by an "
"orange icon/button in the 'select current spell' area.||Spells that are "
"memorized cost mana to cast, but they can be used as long as the character "
"has mana to power them. The Warrior and Rogue start the game with no "
"memorized spells while the sorcerer begins with Firebolt.  If the character "
"finds a book in the labyrinth, he can memorize the spell written in that "
"book by opening the Inventory screen and right-clicking on the book.  This "
"will make that spell always available to the character for casting. "
"Memorized spells can be readied through either the Spellbook or Speedbook "
"and are represented by a blue icon/button in the 'select current spell' "
"area.||$Important note on books:|Reading more than one book increases your "
"knowledge of that spell and gives you the spell at a higher level. The "
"higher the level of a spell the more effective it is.||While some spells "

"available spells and highlighting the one you wish to assign. ||$Health and "
"Mana:|The two orbs in the Information Bar display your life and mana. The "
"red sphere of fluid on the left side of the control panel represents the "
"overall health of your character. When the fluid is gone - your character is "
"dead.||The blue fluid on the right side of the control panel represents your "

"to cast spells.  When the liquid in the sphere is low or depleted, you may "
"be unable to cast some (or all) of your spells.||$Information Bar:|The "

"the arcane powers of the world. This statistic plays a large part in  "
