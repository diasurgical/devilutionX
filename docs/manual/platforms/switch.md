# DevilutionX (Diablo 1) for Nintendo Switch

## Installation

1. Download and unzip [devilutionx-switch.zip](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/releases/latest/download/devilutionx-switch.zip).
2. Put `devilutionx.nro` into `/switch/devilutionx`
3. Copy `diabdat.mpq` from your CD (or GoG install folder) to `/switch/devilutionx`.

## Usage

Launch `devilutionx.nro`. (Do not use album to launch; see the note below.)

*Note:* Hold R on any installed game and launch it. Do not use album to launch. If you use album, the homebrew will only have a small amount memory available, and the touch keyboard won't work. This is true for all homebrew, not just DevilutionX.
