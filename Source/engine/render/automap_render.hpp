/**
 * @file automap_render.hpp
 * Defines 2 sets of rendering primitives for drawing automap lines.
 *
 * 1. DrawMapLine* - used for rendering most map lines - 2 pixels horizontally for each pixel vertically.
 * 2. DrawMapLineSteep* - currently only used for rendering the player arrow - 2 pixels vertically for each pixel horizontally.
 *
 * These functions draw a single extra pixel at the end of the line -- they always draw an odd number of pixels.
 * These functions clip to the output buffer -- they are safe to call with out-of-bounds coordinates.
